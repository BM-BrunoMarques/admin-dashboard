# Admin Dashboard - React & Typescript


### Author: Bruno Marques
<br />


This APP is an example of an UI for an Admin Dashboard that I created from scratch. It allows you to consult your data dynamically through Maps tables and charts. And also provides menus for users and orders management so you can add or delete users and orders to the website.
The goal with this App was to create a solid base for an admin dashboard in which I will keep on adding new functionalities.

## Insights

This was meant to be a frontend only project, so any interactions that I am having with the backend, are being reprodruced through a fake backend that I created. I did a "Monkey Path" to the fetch function, and intercept it whenever necessary to simulate the data processing and server response


##Techonologies
This project was all built in **React**, mainly with **Hooks** and **functional components**. **Typescript**.
 **Redux ToolKit** for state management. **Formik** and **Yup** for forms validation and **framer-motion** for animations.
